####################################

Day 1
------------------------------------
TLOs:
Be able to look at code and identify what the code does or what the output should be
Be able to solve simple problems by creating code
------------------------------------

Processes and memory (ps, kill, killall, pkill, top)
commands: cat, more, or less
finding files and directories (locate, whereis, which, find) (Use find a lot)
commands: grep and cut

------------------------------------
SHELL - A sell is a macro processor that executes commands.
1. Command Interpreter
2. Programming language
Interactive vs non-interactive (Interactive is command input)(DCO mostly uses non-interactive)
------------------------------------
Linux commands and switches
cat /etc/passwd ()

ctrl-a - brings cursor to the beginnning
ctrl-e - brings cursor to the end
ctrl-u - erases the line
ctrl-c - starts a new line
ctrl-r - search bar for keywords of commands
ctrl-l - creates a new screen that you can scroll back up from
shift-G - will go to the last line of a man page
shift-g - will go to the first line of a man page
/ - searches in a man page
n - brings you to the next search after searching a man page
shift-n - brings you to the previous search in a a man page
q - quits man page

linux.die.net/man/ ----- Online man page for linux

man pages - provide syntax and specifications for commands in the shell

Commands
######################################
pwd - print working directory
touch - create a file in linux (vim, nano, vi also work)
touch -t -- changes time and date of files
mkdir -p -- makes a directory inside of another directory (directory and subdirectory)
rm - removes
rmdir - removes directory (-p removes directories and subdirectories, -rf forces it to be removed)
ls - lists the contents of a directory (-l shows in a list format, -a shows hidden files)
* - wildcard character
cp - copy (path:destination)
mv - move
ln - creates a link (-s symbolic)
echo - print
find - finds, pretty fucking self explanatory

Find
Very important command in linux
find 'location of where to look' 'what you want to look for
find $home -name new.sh (looks in the home directory for anything that has new.sh in it)
-name is case sensitive
-iname is not case sensitive
find -size (finds the size of a file)
find / -group root (looks in the root directory, everything that belongs to the root group)
find $home -user student (looking for anything in the home directory that belongs to student)
-maxdepth (max depth will define how many levels deep in the file system to search when using find)
find / -type <d f p l> (searches the root directory for the type of file, d is directory, f is for files, p is for pipes, l is for symbolic links)
-exec will run a command with the find command (example -exec ls -l will list out the contents)
find / -type d -iname log -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null (\ is the termination point for the exec switch)(prints all of the name that have log)
-exec ls -l {} \; (syntax purely for the above command that will cause the command to not work without that portion)
find / -atime (looks at accessed time of files, by default will look according to days)
find / -mmin (looks at files based on the timeframe, in minutes with this switch)
find / -executable ! -type d (looks for all files that are executable and not directories)
find /var/log -iname *.log 2>/dev/null -printf "%i %f\n" | more (looks in var/log for case insensitive files that end in .log, throws away all of the errors and prints inode number and filename)

grep
can utilize grep to compare files
cat /etc/passwd | grep /bin/bash (shows the file where it was found)
cat /etc/passwd | grep -C 3 student (-C is the context flag, shows the 3 lines before and 3 lines after the grep was found)
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v /bin/bash (-v inverts the results, shows everything that does not have a match)
-n shows the line number
grep 'root' /etc/passwd (finds root in /etc/passwd)
-A is a context flag, only shows after the hit was found
-B is a context flag, shows before the hit was found
egrep allows regex as strings
egrep -o shows the result and after if specified but not before
egrep "student|root|ROOT" /etc/passwd (looks for student, root, or ROOT and shows the whole line where it was found)

Hard link vs symbolic link

Symbolic link
Acts like a dynamic link, gets deleted if the original file gets deleted, can exists across multiple devices

Hard link
A hard link is a more static link, only exists in the system it is created in, does not get deleted if the original gets deleted

BRACE EXPANSION
Do whatever command we want, multiple times

touch file{1..5} (creates files 1-5 in the same location)
touch log{1..5}.txt (creates log.txt 1-5)

Processes
ps aux(shows all processes that are running on the system and what user is using the process)
  -u shows the processes being used by the specified user

Cut command
Changes standard output
Relies on character deliminator, default is tab
tail /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1 (shows the first word (field) of each of the lines that would be diplayed on tail /etc/passwd)
