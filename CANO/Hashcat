--------------
Hashcat is a popular and effective hash cracking utility used by penetration testers and other security professionals as well as criminals.
(aircrack is the "backup" for hashcat)

PSK = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA1, Passphrase + SSID, 4096, 256)

There are numerous hash cracjing strategies: 
Dictionary attacks
Combination attacks
Mask attacks
Rules-based attacks

Hashcat:
sudo apt install hashcat

hcstools: (A suite of tools to convert packets to hashcat WPA2 file formats)
sudo apt install hcxtools

Download seclists:
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists

should have a directory of ~/.hashcat
if not:
mkdir ~/.hashcat

Hashcat supports almost 500 hash types

For WPA2 we will use 22000
To baseline your hardware setup for a certain hash type:
hashcat -b -m 22000

If hashcat fails check the graphics in the settings, make sure to be using the dedicated graphics card and not the CPU.
