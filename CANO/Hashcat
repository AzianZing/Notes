Hashcat Basics
--------------
Hashcat is a popular and effective hash cracking utility used by penetration testers and other security professionals as well as criminals.
(aircrack is the "backup" for hashcat)

PSK = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA1, Passphrase + SSID, 4096, 256)

There are numerous hash cracjing strategies: 
Dictionary attacks
Combination attacks
Mask attacks
Rules-based attacks

Hashcat:
sudo apt install hashcat

hcstools: (A suite of tools to convert packets to hashcat WPA2 file formats)
sudo apt install hcxtools

Download seclists:
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists

should have a directory of ~/.hashcat
if not:
mkdir ~/.hashcat

Hashcat supports almost 500 hash types

For WPA2 we will use 22000
To baseline your hardware setup for a certain hash type:
hashcat -b -m 22000

If hashcat fails check the graphics in the settings, make sure to be using the dedicated graphics card and not the CPU.

We need to extract the necessary variables from an EAPOL handshake or PMKID to a format Hashcat uses.

hcxpcapngtool will automatically extract those variables to a 22000 format file
hcxpcapngtool -o hash.22000 <inputfile>.pcap

# Modes

0 Straight
1 Combination
3 Brute-Force (Mask)
6 Hybrid Word List + Mask
7 Hybrid Mask + Word list

Dictionary Attacks - 0
-----------------
Since humans tend to use bad password, dictionary attacks can be an effective strategy.
The "rockyou.txt" word list contains over 14 million leaked passwords.

Pre-process:
hcxpcapngtool -o dict.22000 dictionary.pcap

Usage example:
hashcat -a 0 -m 22000 dict.22000 /path/to/rockyou.txt.tar.gz

If given a hex SSID:
Convert using
echo "<HEX> | xxd -r -p

Extract hashes from oconus_sample.cap
hcxpcapngtool -o oconus.22000 oconus_sample.cap

Run a dictionary attack
hashcat -a 0 -m 22000 oconus.22000 /path/to/rockyou.txt.tar.gz

Combination Attacks - 1
-----------------
Concatenates words from multiple word lists
wordlist1wordlist2

pre-process:
hcxpcapngtool -o combo.22000 combination.pcap

example:
hashcat -a 1 -m 22000 combo.22000 wordlist1 wordlist2

Brute-Force / Mask Attacks
-----------------
Tries all characters from given character set, per position

Example:
Lots of users tend to use passwords in a certain format (word1234) or vendors tend to use default passwords in a predictable format

? | Character Sets
--
l | a-z
u | A-Z
d | 0-9
h | 0-9a-f
H | 0-9A-F

hashcat -a 3 -m 22000 mask.22000 ?a4?aT?a6?aM
