MAC Address Changing
-----------
When not in "monitor mode", external wi-fi interfaces behave as a normal wireless device (probe requests)
The MAC addresses of your wireless cards are a unique identified to you and your operations
They can be used to target you in the same manner as you target others
Randomize wireless interface MACs as a baseline pre-mission activity. Or to a specific MAC as approppriate for network reconnaissance tasks.

Don't associate to a target access point with an Alfa card MAC address...

Alfa Card MACs are 00:0C:0A

ON PI AND LAPTOP
-----------
sudo apt install macchanger

Bring interface down first:
sudo ifconfig wlan1 down

Change to a specified MAC
sudo macchanger -m <MAC> wlan1

Change to random MAC
sudo macchanger -r wlan1

macchanger --list (shows OUI dictionary)

Proper order of mission checklist
----------------------------------------------

turn off wifi
rfkill (checks status of devices)
rfkill block/unblock wlan
