Remote Authentication
--------
We will use wpa_supplicant to connect to our target network
--
ps -ef | grep wpa_supplicant (find and kill unwanted process)
sudo ifconfig <interface> down
sudo macchanger -r <interface>
sudo ifconfig <interface> up

Assign WPA supplicant to your Alfa card:
--
sudo wpa_supplicant -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/<wpa_supplicant.conf> -i <interface> -B
