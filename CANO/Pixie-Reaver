Pixie-Reaver / Pixie Dust / Bully
----------------
WPS Brute force attack


On Laptop and Pi
----------------------------
sudo apt install pixiewps

Pixiewps is a tool that attacks a flaw in the randomization of WPS hashes

sudo apt install reaver

Reaver is an old school way to defeat WPS hashes, the noraml attack has since been patched on most wireless access points
Reaver can be combined with pixiewps for attacks that still work on WPS today!

WPS PIN Breakdown
----
Total of 10,000,000 unique WPS pin possibilities
You used to be able to brute force this with Reaver in a few minutes, since patched (2013)
Now you get locked out after a few attempts
It is rare to find a router that is vulnerable to brute force the WPS pin

https://tacticalware.com/list-of-wireless-ap-router-invulnerable-to-pixie-dust-attack/

Pixiedust attacks works against a good amount of TP-Link and other routers
It is nearly impossible to tel exactly what percentage of routers are vulnerable to this, since those stats are not commonly kept
The only way to know for sure, is to test every other router you can get your hands on
Above is a hacking forum that maintauns a list of SUPPOSEDLY vulnerable devices

Six Variables Required
