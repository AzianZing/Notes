WPS Brute force attack


On Laptop and Pi

sudo apt install pixiewps

Pixiewps is a tool that attacks a flaw in the randomization of WPS hashes

sudo apt install reaver

Reaver is an old school way to defeat WPS hashes, the noraml attack has since been patched on most wireless access points
Reaver can be combined with pixiewps for attacks that still work on WPS today!

You used to be able to brute force this with Reaver in a few minutes, since patched (2013)
Now you get locked out after a few attempts
It is rare to find a router that is vulnerable to brute force the WPS pin
