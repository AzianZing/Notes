What is targeting?
Targeting is a combination of intelligence functions, planning, battle command, weaponeering, operational execution and combat assessment(CA) used to meet a desired end state.

Using the right tool, for right target, at the right time.

Targeting is a continuous process that maintains pace with the dynamics of an ever-chaning battlefield situation. In addition to the enemy situation, the inputs that drive this process come from higher headquarters' plans, orders, and priorities.
