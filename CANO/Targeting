Purpose of Intelligence
----
Reduce uncertainty for a decision maker
Enabling "Decision Advantage" for decision-makers at all levels.
What is targeting?
Targeting is a combination of intelligence functions, planning, battle command, weaponeering, operational execution and combat assessment(CA) used to meet a desired end state.

Using the right tool, for right target, at the right time.

Targeting is a continuous process that maintains pace with the dynamics of an ever-chaning battlefield situation. In addition to the enemy situation, the inputs that drive this process come from higher headquarters' plans, orders, and priorities.


F3EAD Cycle
------------
Find
Fix - Goal is pattern of life
Finish - persistent collection of a product 
Exploit - gain access and see what the target is doing
Analyze - 
Disseminate - Is infinite and goes in with all of the steps

How is intelligence converted from data into action?

How are the results of actions converted into ongoing intelligence?

What do I know? 
Who needs to know it? 
Have I told them?


Find phase
--
The start point for intelligence collection (do not focus too much on one area that you miss a whole lot of other important information)


SIGINT - Find
--
Close Target Recon, ISR, Source enabled operations, content analysis
The goal is to get the target identified and plan for follow on operations to achieve time place predictability required for desired end state.


Fix phase
--
Once a target is identified, the full gamut of intelligence collection capability is applied against the target in order to decelop operational triggers to "fox" the target in space and time.

ISR, CTR, COLLECTION, Pattern of Life (POL) DEVELOPMENT, LOCATIONAL DATA

To have a target "FIXED" you have a good POL to include Bed Down Location (BDL), work, associated. Put plainly a fix is making a target time place predictable. Thiis allows for operations against this target to succeed. 
Put a pin in the map!
