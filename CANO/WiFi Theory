# MISSION PREP #
GATHERING ALL OF THE RIGHT MATERIALS SO THAT YOU DO NOT INSTALL INCORRECT EQUIPMENT/CABLES/ANTENNAS AND CAUSE A MISSION FAILURE, CHECKS CAN PREVENT FUTURE ISSUES AND POTENTIAL FAILURES
IF NOT RECEIVING ANY SORT OF SIGNALS DEFAULT TO THE MOST BASIC ASPECTS OF SIGINT/INTEL TO POTENTIALLY GET RESULTS

# RF Theory #
####
# RF Behaviors #
----
Scattering - Scattering of signals as they bounce off of a surface
Diffraction - RF path changing as the signal hits a surface and forms a 'gravitational pull' around the object
Reflection - Directly bouncing off of a target
Refraction - Bouncing of a signal resulting in the signal going in multiple different directions rather than in one direction
Absorption - Signal being absorbed by a surface

# RF Key Terms #
----
TX Power (typically ~20 dBm)
Cable Loss (greater at high freqs)
Gain
Path Loss/multipath
RSSI

ALFA Cards are reverse polarity and regular coax cables are not reverse polarity and will screw up the ALFA card
WiFi collection devices are reverse polarity

# WiFi Signal Strengths #
####

# Signal Strength #
----
-30dBm  Amazing  Max achievable strength, few feet away
-67 dBm  Very Good  Minimum strength for applications that require reliable, timely delivery of packets   required for VOiP/WiFi/streaming video
-70 dBm  Okay  minimum signal strength for reliable packet delivery  required for email, web
-80 dBm   Not Good  Minimum for basic connections, packet delivery may be unreliable
-90 dBm  unusable  Approaching or drowning in the noise floor, functionality highly unlikely

# WiFi Standards #

Bandwidth channels of WiFi (20/22/40/60/80)

# 2.4 GHz Spectrum #
1, 6, 11 non-overlapping
DSSS vs OFDM
Channel bonding
ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) Band
  -Interference Heavy

# 5 GHz Spectrum #
Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII) Bands - Power restrictions
25 non-overlapping channels (channel 144 was added later on for...)
Channel bonding
Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) (checks for radar signals and if radar signals are detected, the new equipment must switch)
