# RF Theory #
####
# RF Behaviors #
----
Scattering - Scattering of signals as they bounce off of a surface
Diffraction - RF path changing as the signal hits a surface and forms a 'gravitational pull' around the object
Reflection - Directly bouncing off of a target
Refraction - Bouncing of a signal resulting in the signal going in multiple different directions rather than in one direction
Absorption - Signal being absorbed by a surface

# RF Key Terms #
----
TX Power (typically ~20 dBm)
Cable Loss (greater at high freqs)
Gain
Path Loss/multipath
RSSI

ALFA Cards are reverse polarity and regular coax cables are not reverse polarity and will screw up the ALFA card
WiFi collection devices are reverse polarity

# WiFi Signal Strengths #

# Signal Strength #
----
-30dBm  Amazing  Max achievable strength, few feet away
-67 dBm  Very Good  Minimum strength for applications that require reliable, timely delivery of packets   required for VOiP/WiFi/streaming video
-70 dBm  Okay  minimum signal strength for reliable packet delivery  required for email, web
-80 dBm   Not Good  Minimum for basic connections, packet delivery may be unreliable
-90 dBm  unusable  Approaching or drowning in the noise floor, functionality highly unlikely

# WiFi Standards #

Bandwidth channels of WiFi (20/22/40/60/80)

# 2.4 GHz Spectrum #
1, 6, 11 non-overlapping
DSSS vs OFDM
Channel bonding
ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) Band
  -Interference Heavy

# 5 GHz Spectrum #
Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII) Bands - Power restrictions
25 non-overlapping channels (channel 144 was added later on for...)
Channel bonding
Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) (checks for radar signals and if radar signals are detected, the new equipment must switch)

# 802.11 Modulation Types #
802.11b Direct Sequence Speed Spectrum
Gain between the top of the spread signal and the peak of the narrowband signal is known as "processing gain"
1.Resistance to intended or unintended jamming
2.sharing of a single channel among multiple users
3.reduced signal/background-noise level hampers interception

# Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) #
Sub-carriers are orthogonal to each other, meaning that cross-talk between the sub-channles is eliminated
Large number of closely-spaced sub-carriers are used to carry data; divided into seversal parallel data streams or channels, 1 per sub-carrier
Number of orthogonal sub-carriers is 52 with a sub-carrier spacing of 312.5 KHz, giving a total bandwidth of 16.25 MHz.

Orthogonal means that sub-carriers will not collide, the bands have "guards" on them that prevent the signals from crossing

# Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) is a multi-user version of OFDM
Multiple access is achieved by assigning subcarriers to multiple users
This allows simultaneous transmission to/from several users

# WLAN Architecture #
Stations (STA)
  All components in a wireless LAN
Categories
  Access Points
  Clients

# WLAN Identifiers #
Media Access Control (MAC) Address:
  48-bit unique identifier
  Assigned to every Network Interface Card (NIC)
  Serves as a physical address within a network
  First three octets are known as the OUI or Organizationally Unique Identifier
    Denoted the vendor or manufacturer

OUI lookup tool, wireshark OUI lookup tool: https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html
(Routers that are multi-band will have multiple different MAC addresses, the 2.4GHz band will have a MAC and so will the 5GHz band, most times they are only one bit off)

MAC Address Types
Unicast Address
  Second Character, 1st Octet is 0, 4, 8, C
  OUI bytes issed by IEEE + Unique Bytes
Multicast Address
  Second character, 1st octet is 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, B, D, F
  Multicast OUI bytes reserved by IEEE + Unique bytes set by multicast application
Broadcast MAC Address
  FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
** 2,6,A,E as the second character, 1st octet signified a locally administered (or randomized) MAC address **

Basic Service Set (BSS)
  Identified by the BSSID (MAC Address) of the access point
  Identified by the service set identifier (SSID)
Extended Service Set (ESS) (Example: Hotels that have free wifi, normally have a bunch of different access points that push out the same SSID, providing the same network through different access points, have different BSSIDs but the same SSID)
  A group of interconnected WLANs that appear as a single BSS
  Identified by the SSID of the APs
  One Distribution System
Mesh Basic Service Set (MBSS)
  Identified by the BSSID (MAC Address) of the access points
  Identified by the service set identifier (SSID)
  Multiple redistribution nodes
  Traffic routing is done between all nodes
  Nodes communicate with one another
  Self-healing
Idependent Basic Service Set (IBSS)
  Also called an ad-hoc network
  Access point is not involved
  All clients communicate directly to one another

# 802.11 Frame Types #
Management Frames
  Used to manage a BSS
  Beacons, probes (request and response), authentication, deauthentication
  Handle connecting and disconnecting clients
Control frames
  Coordinate access to the network medium
  Handles acknowledgements, RTS (request-to-send), CTS (clear-to-send)
Data Frames
  Used to transfer information
  Do not always contain a payload
  Trigger events (device entering power save mode) 

Management Frames
  Beacon Frames
    Transmitted periodically by access points
    Announces the presence of a WLAN
  Key components
    SSID
    Channel
    Standards supported (802.11g,n,ac,ax,etc)
    Encryption Type (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3)
    Timestamp
    Capabilities Information
  Probe Requests
    Sent by the client station
    Requests information from nearby APs
    Provides the client stations capabilites to nearby APs
(If going after Probe Requests specifically, consider camping on one channel to capture the probe request, if hopping channels at the same time as target device, you might miss the frame)

  Probe Responses
    Sent back to a client station in response to a probe request
    Contains similar information to a beacon frame
(Sometimes a Probe Response will give more information that could be critical to the collection, can give make and model or even WPS PIN)

Connectionn states
State 1: station is not authenticated and not associated
State 2: station is authenticated but not associated
State 3: station is authenticated and associated
