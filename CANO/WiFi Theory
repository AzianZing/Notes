MISSION PREP
GATHERING ALL OF THE RIGHT MATERIALS SO THAT YOU DO NOT INSTALL INCORRECT EQUIPMENT/CABLES/ANTENNAS AND CAUSE A MISSION FAILURE, CHECKS CAN PREVENT FUTURE ISSUES AND POTENTIAL FAILURES
IF NOT RECEIVING ANY SORT OF SIGNALS DEFAULT TO THE MOST BASIC ASPECTS OF SIGINT/INTEL TO POTENTIALLY GET RESULTS

RF Theory
####
RF Behaviors
----
Scattering - Scattering of signals as they bounce off of a surface
Diffraction - RF path changing as the signal hits a surface and forms a 'gravitational pull' around the object
Reflection - Directly bouncing off of a target
Refraction - Bouncing of a signal resulting in the signal going in multiple different directions rather than in one direction
Absorption - Signal being absorbed by a surface

RF Key Terms
----
TX Power (typically ~20 dBm)
Cable Loss (greater at high freqs)
Gain
Path Loss/multipath
RSSI

ALFA Cards are reverse polarity and regular coax cables are not reverse polarity and will screw up the ALFA card
WiFi collection devices are reverse polarity

WiFi Signal Strengths
####

Signal Strength
----
-30dBm  Amazing  Max achievable strength, few feet away
-67 dBm  Very Good  Minimum strength for applications that require reliable, timely delivery of packets
-70 dBm  Okay  minimum signal strength for reliable packet delivery
-80 dBm   Not Good  Minimum for basic connections, packet delivery may be unreliable
-90 dBm  unusable  Approaching or drowning in the noise floor, functionality highly unlikely
