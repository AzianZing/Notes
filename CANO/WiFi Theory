RF Theory
####
RF Behaviors
----
Scattering - Scattering of signals as they bounce off of a surface
Diffraction - RF path changing as the signal hits a surface and forms a 'gravitational pull' around the object
Reflection - Directly bouncing off of a target
Refraction
Absorption - Signal being absorbed by a surface

RF Key Terms
----
TX Power (typically ~20 dBm)
Cable Loss (greater at high freqs)
Gain
Path Loss/multipath
RSSI

ALFA Cards are reverse polarity and regular coax cables are not reverse polarity and will screw up the ALFA card
WiFi collection devices are reverse polarity
