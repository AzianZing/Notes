Wireshark basics
WLAN Addresses:
  Source Address         Who first sent the packet?
  Transmitter Address    Who (wifi) sent the packet?
  Receiver address       who (wifi) received it?
  Destination address    where it needs to end up

Look in tagged parameters
Look in RSN information (encryption, AES (CCM) = WPA2, SAE (GCM) = WPA3)
