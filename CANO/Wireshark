Install Wireshark
---------
sudo apt install wireshark

Wireshark basics
WLAN Addresses:
  Source Address         Who first sent the packet?
  Transmitter Address    Who (wifi) sent the packet?
  Receiver address       who (wifi) received it?
  Destination address    where it needs to end up

Look in tagged parameters
Look in RSN information (encryption, AES (CCM) = WPA2, SAE (GCM) = WPA3) 

PE Beacons:
File: Survey&Analysis.pcapng

Identify the access points that use the SSID of IMGUEST
  What are their BSSIDs?
  WHat Channels are used by esach?
  What standards are supported?

PE Probes:
  File Surbey&Analysis.pcapng

  What devices have the network 'IMGUEST' in their preferred networks list?
  What standards do these clients support?
  Do any of these devices probe for any other networks?

Useful Wireshark filters:
  wlan.ssid
  wlan.fc.type_subtype
  wlan.addr

Decrypting Traffic
Wireshark allows for decyrting traffic, provided you have the network credentials and collected the session encryption (eapol).
To add a network ket, Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> IEEE802.11
key type - password:SSID

Another way to decrypt traffic is using airdecap
Usage:
airdecap-ng -e <SSID> -p <password> <inputfile>
wireshark <newfile>.dec.pcap

Wireshark can receive the real-time input from either airodump or kismet and disply the frames captures
In one terminal, run airodump-ng
In a second terminal, birng up wireshark (as sudo), attach it to wlan

TShark
----------------
TShark Basics
----
Tshark is the command line version of wireshark
Tshark can process filters much faster than wireshark
Tshark can be combined with bash scripting to automate processes
Locate the tshark.pcapppi file within CLI

Your tshark query will usualy look something like the following
  tshark -r <inputfile> -Y '<display filters' -T fields -e <column>
  The tshark.pcapppi file is over 88 MB and contains extraneous data that we do not care about
  Our goal is to strip out the network using the SSID "Three Rivers Hotel WIFI" and determine how many AP were collected
tshark -r tshark.pcapppi -Y 'wlan.ssid=="Three Rivers Hotel WIFI" && (wlan.fc.type_subtype==8 || wlan.fc.type_subtype==5)' -T fields -e wlan.ta -e wlan.ssid -E separator=, -E header=y > 3_rivers.csv
sort -u 3_rivers.csv | tee 3_rivers_uniq.csv

tshark -r tshark.pcapppi -Y 'wlan.ssid=="Three Rivers Hotel WIFI" && (wlan.fc.type_subtype==8 || wlan.fc.type_subtype==5 || wlan.tag.number == 45 || wlan.tag.number == 221)' -T fields -e wlan.bssid -e wlan.ssid -e wps.wifi_protected_setup_state -e wps.manufacturer -e wps.model_name -e wps.model_number -e wps.serial_number -e wps.device_name -e wlan_radio.channel -e wlan.tag.number -e wlan.vht.capabilities -e wlan.ht.capabilities -E separator=, -E header=y > 3_rivers.csv

tshark -r tshark.pcapppi -Y 'wlan.ssid=="Three Rivers Hotel WIFI" && (wlan.fc.type_subtype==8 || wlan.fc.type_subtype==5)' -T fields -e wlan.ssid -e wlan.bssid -e wlan.ds.current_channel -e wlan.rsn.gcs -e wps.wifi_protected_setup_state -e wps.manufacturer -e wps.model_name -e wps.model_number -e wps.serial_number -e wps.rf_bands -E separator=, -E header=y > 3_rivers.csv
