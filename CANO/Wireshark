Wireshark basics
WLAN Addresses:
  Source Address         Who first sent the packet?
  Transmitter Address    Who (wifi) sent the packet?
  Receiver address       who (wifi) received it?
  Destination address    where it needs to end up

Look in tagged parameters
Look in RSN information (encryption, AES (CCM) = WPA2, SAE (GCM) = WPA3) 

PE Beacons:
File: Survey&Analysis.pcapng

Identify the access points that use the SSID of IMGUEST
  What are their BSSIDs?
  WHat Channels are used by esach?
  What standards are supported?

PE Probes:
  File Surbey&Analysis.pcapng

  What devices have the network 'IMGUEST' in their preferred networks list?
  What standards do these clients support?
  Do any of these devices probe for any other networks?

Useful Wireshark filters:
  wlan.ssid
  wlan.fc.type_subtype
  wlan.addr

Decrypting Traffic
Wireshark allows for decyrting traffic, provided you have the network credentials and collected the session encryption (eapol).
To add a network ket, Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> IEEE802.11
key type - password:SSID

Another way to decrypt traffic is using airdecap
Usage:
airdecap-ng -e <SSID> -p <password> <inputfile>
wireshark <newfile>.dec.pcap
