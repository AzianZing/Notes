Network Fundamentals
------------------
OSI Model
******
Physical (Layer 1 Physical Connections - Ethernet, Fiber, Radio Waves, etc)
Data Link (Layer 2 Communication - How the devices communicate, Internet version, etc)
Network (Layer 3 Internet Protocol - IPv4, IPv6, etc)
Transport (Layer 4 Protocols - TCP, UDP)
Session (Layer 5 How a sesion is working - NetBIOS, RPC, etc)
Presentation (Layer 6 File Formats - JPEG, PNG, etc)
Application (Layer 7 Specific Protocols - FTP, IMAP, Telnet, etc)

Physical Layer
^^^^^^

Data Link Layer
^^^^^^
MAC (Media Access Control) vs LLC (Logical Link Control)
Ethernet Header
******
First 7 bytes, Preamble
1 byte delimiter, SFD

Ethernet Frame
Destination MAC Address, Source MAC Address, Ethertype, Payload, CRC/FCS

Ethertype
******
0x0800 - IPv4
0x0806 - ARP
0x86DD - IPv6
0x8100 - VLAN Tag

VLAN Header
******
VLAN Tag between Source MAC Address and Ethertype
Tag Protocol ID - 0x8100 (16 bits)
PCP/DEI (4 bits)
VLAN ID (12 bits)

ARP Header
******
Hardware Type starts at Byte Offset 0, Protocol Type starts at Byte Offest 2
Security Concerns
++++
Does not require an ARP request
Host forcing an ARP reply until all hosts update ARP tables, creates a MitM attack


Network Layer
^^^^^^
IPv4 Headers
Default value of Version is 4
Default value of Header Length is 5
Header Length is number of words in IP Header
TTL - Windows only uses ICMP, Linux uses TCP with ICMP
Firewalking - Traceroute command, sending a request to devices that you are connected to, most are /30 subnets and are not accessible for the most part

Fragmentation
!!!!!!
If a packet is too big to send all at once it will fragment and send the data with different fragments so the receiver may receive the data properly
Reserve, Dont Fragment, More Fragment Bits followed by 13 fragment bits
MTU - (IHLx4) = Data Fragments
Offset increments by the amount of 8 bit chunks that can fit into the receiving end MTU

IPv6 Headers
Much less complicated than IPv4 Headers
No Fragmenting, no header checksum, no identification
Flow Label
Source Address and Destination Address are 128 bits long instead of 32 due to IPv6 being 128 bit long addressing
If fragmentation is needed the sender reaches out to the receiver, the receiver says that it needs fragmented and the sender will fragment before sending the data to the receiver

Fingerprinting
TTLs and TCP window size

ICMP Headers

IPv4 Address Auto-Configuration
APIPA
RFC 3927
APIPA Addresses are not routable and are 169.254.0.0/16 addresses

IPv6 Address Auto-Configuration
SLAAC (StateLess Address Auto-Configuration)
RFC 4862



Mathematics of Networking
------------------
Bits = 1 bit
Nibbles = 4 bits (Hex character also)
Bytes = 8 bits
Half Words = 16 bits
Words = 32 bits
Double Words = 64 bits
Quad Words = 128 bits

Base2 = Binary
Base10 = Decimal
Base16 = Hex
Base64 = Used for Encoding, +/.= are signs of Base64

Encapsulation and Decapsulation
------------------
Layers
******
Layer1 = Bit
Layer2 = Ethernet Frame
Layer3 = IP Packet
Layer4 = TCP Segment
